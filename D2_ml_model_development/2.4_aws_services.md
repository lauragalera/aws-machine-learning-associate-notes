# Using SageMaker Canvas

Amazon SageMaker Canvas gives you the ability to use machine learning to generate predictions without needing to write any code. The following are some use cases where you can use SageMaker Canvas:

- Predict customer churn

- Plan inventory efficiently

- Optimize price and revenue

- Improve on-time deliveries

- Classify text or images based on custom categories

- Identify objects and text in images

- Extract information from documents

To bring your model into SageMaker Canvas, you need to meet the following requirements:

- You must have a Amazon SageMaker Studio Classic user who has onboarded to Amazon SageMaker AI domain. The Studio Classic user must be in the same domain as the Canvas user.

- For any model that you’ve built outside of SageMaker AI, you must register your model in Model Registry before importing it into Canvas.

- The Canvas user with whom you want to share your model must have permission to access the Amazon S3 bucket in which you store your datasets and model artifacts.

# Using SageMaker Built-In Algorithms

Amazon SageMaker provides a suite of **built-in, high-performance algorithms** designed for various machine learning tasks. These are optimized for speed and scalability, requiring minimal setup.

# Integrating Models Built Outside SageMaker

## Importing Pre-built Models into SageMaker

- Amazon SageMaker supports importing and deploying pre-trained models built outside SageMaker.
- Compatible frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn.
- Enables faster inference and scalability by leveraging SageMaker’s managed infrastructure.

## Fine-tuning Pre-trained Models with Custom Datasets

- Fine-tuning involves training a pre-trained model further using your own dataset to improve performance on specific tasks.
- SageMaker JumpStart and Amazon Bedrock provide pre-built foundation models ready for fine-tuning.
- Fine-tuning helps customize models for local contexts or specialized use cases.

## Key Points

- SageMaker enables seamless import and deployment of models built externally.
- Fine-tuning with custom data enhances model relevance and accuracy.
- Use SageMaker JumpStart and Amazon Bedrock for easy access to foundation models.

# Managing Model Versions and Repeatability

## Importance of Versioning and Repeatability  
Ensures consistent model performance in production, enables rollback, and supports auditing.

## Amazon SageMaker Model Registry  
A managed service for ML model version control and governance.

### Key Features
- **Model Versioning:** Track and rollback to previous model versions.
- **Approval Workflow:** Approve or reject models before deployment.
- **Metadata Tracking:** Automatically records training jobs, hyperparameters, and artifacts.
- **Auditing:** Logs who deployed what and when.

### Example  
An e-commerce platform trains monthly recommendation models and uses the Model Registry to track and rollback versions if sales conversion drops.

## Managing Model Metadata for Reproducibility and Compliance

### Metadata Includes:
- Training data details
- Hyperparameters used
- Evaluation metrics
- Deployment logs and approvals

### Benefits  
Allows tracing decisions, avoiding unexpected biases or errors, and supports compliance with regulations.

# Using SageMaker Clarify for Model Insights

## What is Amazon SageMaker Clarify?
- A tool to analyze training data and ML model performance.
- Provides insights into model behavior.
- Detects bias in datasets and models.

## Example Use Case
- A job application ML model may prioritize applicants from “big four” universities over skills.
- SageMaker Clarify helps confirm if such bias exists based on school background.

## Identifying and Mitigating Model Bias
- Bias occurs when an ML model unfairly favors or disadvantages certain groups (gender, age, location, etc.).
- Mitigation techniques include:
  - Rebalancing the dataset
  - Fairness-aware training
  - Post-hoc bias correction

## Example
- In a loan approval model, SageMaker Clarify ensures the model does not discriminate against self-employed applicants such as freelancers or sari-sari store owners.
- Actions can then be taken to mitigate detected bias.

# Convergence Issues and Debugging

## What are Convergence Issues?
- Occur when an ML model fails to reach optimal performance during training.
- Causes include:
  - Poor data quality
  - Incorrect hyperparameter settings
  - Inefficient optimization algorithms

## Debugging Process
1. **Issue Identification**  
   - Check model accuracy, loss curves, and training logs.
2. **Data Analysis**  
   - Ensure dataset is clean and balanced.
3. **Hyperparameter Optimization**  
   - Adjust batch size, learning rate, or model architecture.
4. **AWS Tools**  
   - Use Amazon SageMaker Model Debugger for efficient debugging.

## Example
- A fintech startup faces a non-decreasing loss while training a fraud detection model.
- They analyze outliers and rare fraudulent cases to fix convergence problems.

## Using Amazon SageMaker Model Debugger
- Detects training anomalies and inefficiencies in real time.
- Logs and analyzes model parameters (loss, gradients).
- Prevents issues before deployment.
