## 1.11.1 Data Encryption and Security Techniques

Securing machine learning data is **critical** during ingestion, storage, and processing. AWS provides several tools and best practices to ensure **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **access control**.

### Data Encryption at Rest and In-Transit

- **Encryption at Rest**: Ensures stored data is unreadable without proper decryption keys.
- **Encryption in Transit**: Protects data while being transferred across networks using **SSL/TLS** protocols.

### AWS Key Management Service (KMS)

**AWS KMS** allows users to:
- Create, rotate, and manage encryption keys
- Use AWS-managed or customer-managed keys
- Enforce fine-grained access control for decryption

### AWS Encryption Best Practices

| Category         | Tool / Protocol             | Description                                  |
|------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **At Rest**       | S3 Server-Side Encryption    | Automatically encrypts stored S3 objects     |
| **In Transit**    | SSL/TLS                     | Secure transfer using HTTPS                  |
| **Key Control**   | AWS KMS                     | Centralized encryption key management        |
| **Access Control**| IAM roles & policies        | Restricts access to keys and encrypted data  |

### IAM (Identity and Access Management) Roles

- Define **who** can access data and **what** actions they can perform
- Prevents **unauthorized access or decryption** of sensitive data

### Key Takeaways

- Always **encrypt sensitive data** both at rest and in transit.
- Use **AWS KMS** for centralized, secure encryption key management.
- Secure access with **IAM policies and roles**.
- Use **S3 Server-Side Encryption** and **SSL/TLS** as standard AWS practices.

## 1.11.2 Data Classification, Anonymization, and Masking

To protect user privacy and comply with regulations (like HIPAA or local laws), sensitive data must be classified, masked, or anonymized appropriately before processing.

### Types of Sensitive Information

#### 1. **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**
- Data that can identify a person directly or indirectly.
- Examples: Name, email, phone number, address, government ID.

#### 2. **Protected Health Information (PHI)**
- Health-related personal data tied to an individual.
- Examples: Medical conditions, health records, lab results.

### Key Techniques

| Technique        | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Masking** | Replace actual values with fake but realistic data. Preserves data format.  |
| **Anonymization**| Permanently removes identifying fields so data cannot be traced to a person. |

## 1.11.3 AWS Tools for Data Protection

| Tool         | Use Case                                                                          |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **AWS Glue** | ETL pipelines that include **data masking/anonymization** during transformation.  |
| **AWS Macie**| Uses ML to **discover, classify, and protect** sensitive data like PII in S3.     |

### Best Practices

- **Always classify data types** before processing (PII, PHI, financial).
- Use **masking** when the format must remain usable (e.g., test datasets).
- Use **anonymization** when complete privacy is required.
- Integrate **AWS Macie** for automatic detection and alerts.
- Apply **IAM roles** to restrict access to sensitive processing steps.

## 1.11.4 Validating Data Quality

### AWS Glue DataBrew

A **visual data preparation tool** that:
- Detects anomalies automatically
- Profiles datasets (e.g., types, distributions, missing values)
- Supports cleaning and transformation with minimal code

### AWS Glue Data Quality

Helps validate dataset correctness before ML training:
- Detects **missing values**
- Identifies **schema mismatches**
- Flags **data drift** and **duplicates**

### Key Features & Benefits

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Profiling** | Understands structure and statistical distribution |
| **Validation rules** | Custom checks on value ranges, types, uniqueness |
| **Integration** | Works with SageMaker, Amazon S3, Redshift, and more |

### Best Practices

- Profile datasets **before model training**
- Automate checks for **missing values, duplicates, and schema issues**
- Incorporate **validation rules** into your ETL pipelines
