# Feature Engineering, and Tools

## Feature Engineering Techniques

**Feature engineering** transforms raw data into meaningful inputs for machine learning models, improving accuracy and performance.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA is an unsupervised technique for dimensionality reduction that transforms data into a lower-dimensional space without using labels.

PCA reduces dimensionality by transforming data into principal components that capture the most variance, effectively filtering out noise spread across less important components.

### Data Scaling and Standardization

- **Purpose**: Prevents large-magnitude features (e.g., price) from dominating smaller ones (e.g., number of bedrooms).
- **Techniques**:
  - **MinMaxScaler**: Scales features to a 0–1 range.
  - **StandardScaler**: Normalizes data with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.

### Feature Splitting, Binning, and Log Transformation

- **Feature Binning**: Groups numeric values into ranges (e.g., purchase quantity: 1–3, 4–6, etc.)
- **Log Transformation**: Applies logarithmic scale to reduce skewness in highly variable features.

## Encoding Techniques for ML

**Encoding** transforms categorical/text data into numerical form for use in ML models.


### Encoding Techniques

| Technique        | Description | Example |
|------------------|-------------|---------|
| **One-hot Encoding** | Creates binary vectors for categories | "NCR", "Visayas", "Mindanao" → `[1, 0, 0]` |
| **Binary Encoding**  | Assigns numerical labels, then converts to binary | "Groceries" = 3 → Binary: `011` |
| **Label Encoding**   | Assigns integer values based on category order | "Silver", "Gold", "Platinum" → 0, 1, 2 |

### Tokenization for Text Data

Splits text into smaller units: **words, subwords**, or **characters**.

**Example**  
Filipino headline:  
> "Bumagsak ang presyo ng bigas sa palengke"

| Tokenization Type | Output | Use Case |
|-------------------|--------|----------|
| Word              | ["Bumagsak", "ang", "presyo", ...] | Simpler NLP tasks |
| Subword           | ["Bumag", "sak", "presyo", ...]    | Robust to unknown words |
| Character         | ["B", "u", "m", "a", ...]          | Language-agnostic models |

## Tools for Data Exploration & Feature Engineering

### **SageMaker Data Wrangler**

- No-code environment for cleaning, transforming, and visualizing data.
- Supports:
  - Outlier removal
  - Imputation
  - Feature creation
  - Balancing for classification

### AWS Glue vs AWS Glue DataBrew

| Tool       | Use Case | Interface |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| **AWS Glue** | Serverless ETL for large-scale pipelines | Script-based |
| **DataBrew** | Visual data cleaning and transformation | No-code GUI |

## Transforming Streaming Data

### Real-time Processing with AWS Lambda

- Serverless compute that reacts to events in real time
- Integrates with:
  - **Amazon Kinesis Data Streams**
  - **DynamoDB Streams**

Important: Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is designed for real-time data ingestion and streaming. While it can process large volumes of sensor data in real time, **it does not include built-in anomaly detection capabilities or support data aggregation and preprocessing for machine learning workflows.**

In Kinesis Data Streams, enhanced fan-out provides dedicated throughput to each consumer, ensuring faster data processing with reduced latency, which is crucial for real-time fraud detection.

**Example**  
A fintech company in Quezon City monitors transactions and triggers fraud alerts via Lambda when unusual patterns occur.

### Spark-based Streaming in Amazon EMR

- Leverages Apache Spark on EMR for real-time stream processing at scale
- Great for large, fast-changing datasets

**Example**  
A media company uses EMR with Spark to monitor **live viewer engagement** and update dashboards in near-real-time.
