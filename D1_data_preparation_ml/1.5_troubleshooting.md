## 1.5.1 Common Issues

- **Insufficient Throughput**: Kinesis Data Streams or DynamoDB throttles data when provisioned throughput is exceeded.
- **Storage Constraints**: Amazon S3 bucket misconfigurations or lifecycle mismanagement lead to failed uploads or versioning overload.
- **Scaling Delays**: Amazon RDS or EBS-backed storage underperforms during peak loads due to autoscaling limits or IOPS bottlenecks.
---

## 1.5.2 Diagnostic Techniques

###  Monitor Resource Utilization
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Track metrics like `IncomingBytes`, `WriteThroughputExceeded`, `GetRecords.IteratorAgeMilliseconds`.
- **CloudWatch Alarms**: Set alarms to trigger when key thresholds (e.g., CPU, memory, Kinesis shard limits) are breached.

###  Analyze Traffic Patterns
- Detect ingestion surges by plotting data rate over time.
- Adjust resource allocation during expected peaks (holidays, major events).

### Check AWS Service Limits
- Use **AWS Trusted Advisor** to:
  - Review RDS connection limits.
  - Evaluate S3 object limits or DynamoDB provisioned capacity.

## 1.5.3 Debugging Storage and Ingestion Workflows

### Core AWS Tools

| Tool                      | Use Case                                                                 |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CloudWatch Logs Insights** | Query structured logs from Glue, Lambda, Kinesis pipelines.             |
| **Amazon CloudTrail**     | Audit API calls for access issues or failed service interactions.        |
| **S3 Event Notifications**| Trigger responses to failed uploads, versioning, or object creation.     |
| **AWS Glue Job Metrics**  | Monitor Spark driver/executor performance, I/O times, and retry counts.  |

## 1.5.4 Best Practices

- **Enable Retry Logic**: Use exponential backoff strategies in Lambda, Glue, or custom ingestion scripts.
- **Partitioning**: Partition data in S3 (e.g., by time or region) to improve parallel processing and ingestion performance.
- **Schema Validation**: Validate incoming data against expected schemas before ingestion (use Glue or DataBrew).
