## 1.10.1 Data Preprocessing for Enhanced Model Performance

### Common Problems in ML Models

#### Overfitting
When a model performs well on **training data** but poorly on **new/unseen data**.

How to detect it? A significant gap between training and validation loss typically indicates overfitting, as the model fits the training data too closely but fails to generalize.

#### Prediction Bias
Occurs when a model makes **biased predictions** due to **imbalanced** or **poorly handled data**.

### Key Techniques to Reduce Bias & Overfitting

#### 1. **Cross-Validation**
- Splits dataset into **multiple folds** (e.g., k-fold).
- Ensures model performs well across different data subsets.

#### 2. **Feature Engineering**
- Create **new derived features** to improve model performance.

#### 3. **Regularization**
- Applies penalties to reduce model complexity:
  - **L1 (Lasso)**: Pushes coefficients to zero (feature selection).
  - **L2 (Ridge)**: Penalizes large weights smoothly.

L1 regularization (Lasso) also reduces model complexity and can help with variance by eliminating features. However, it introduces sparsity and may discard useful correlated features, making L2 a more suitable choice when all features contribute value.

#### 4. **Handling Imbalanced Datasets**
- Use:
  - **Oversampling** (e.g., SMOTE),
  - **Undersampling**, or
  - **Class weighting**.

#### 5. **Temperature Scaling**
- **Post-training** calibration technique.
- Adjusts prediction probabilities to better reflect real-world uncertainty.

### Optimizing Training Data via Transformation & Augmentation

#### 1.  Data Transformations
- Improve data quality and model learning:
  - **Normalization** (e.g., MinMaxScaler)
  - **Standardization** (e.g., z-score)
  - **One-Hot Encoding / Label Encoding**

#### 2. Data Augmentation
- Increases data variety **without collecting new data**.

### Summary

- Use **cross-validation** and **regularization** to combat overfitting.
- Apply **feature engineering** and **data transformations** to enrich inputs.
- Fight **bias** with proper dataset balancing and **temperature scaling**.
- For robust generalization, integrate **augmentation techniques** across domains like weather, health, and fraud detection.


## 1.10.2 Data Loading and Configuration for Model Training

Efficient data loading is crucial for fast, scalable machine learning training. In AWS, your data is typically stored in Amazon S3, and you use Amazon SageMaker to train your models. SageMaker offers several ways to access your S3 data during training:

### Efficient Data Loading Strategies

- **Batch Data Loading:** Splits dataset into mini-batches during training. Reduces memory usage and allows smooth processing.
- **Pre-fetching and Data Pipelining:** Prepares the next data batch while the current one is processed, reducing idle time.
- **Data Caching:** Stores frequently accessed data in memory (especially from remote sources like S3), reducing I/O operations and boosting performance.
- **Sharding:** Divides large datasets into independent shards for parallel training in distributed systems.

### SageMaker Data Access Modes

- **File Mode:** SageMaker downloads the entire dataset from S3 to the local storage attached to your training instance before training starts. Your training script reads data from local disk. Best for small/medium datasets or when you need random access to files.
- **Fast File Mode:** Designed to accelerate file system operations when using managed network file systems such as **Amazon FSx for Lustre** or **Amazon EFS** as the data source for training jobs. It reduces the overhead associated with metadata operations and file handling, providing faster file access and lower latency during training.
- **Pipe Mode:** SageMaker streams data directly from S3 to your training container as it is needed, using a named pipe. Training can start immediately, and data is read on-the-fly. Best for very large datasets—no need to wait for a full download or use lots of disk space.

### Amazon FSx for Lustre

For datasets that are too large for File Mode, contain many small files that are hard to serialize, or require random read access patterns, Amazon FSx for Lustre offers a high-performance solution. SageMaker mounts the FSx for Lustre file system directly to the training instance’s file system before starting the training script. The mount operation is fast and does not depend on the dataset size.

FSx for Lustre can scale to hundreds of gigabytes per second of throughput and millions of IOPS with very low latency, making it ideal for workloads with many small files or demanding performance requirements.
- Ideal for high-performance computing (HPC) and ML workloads.
- Seamless integration with Amazon S3 for massive data access.

### Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)
- Scales automatically and supports **parallel EC2 access**.
- Replicates data across **multiple Availability Zones** (AZs).
