# Troubleshooting Data Ingestion and Storage Issues

Reliable data ingestion and storage are foundational to any ML pipeline. However, performance degradation, throughput bottlenecks, and storage misconfigurations can cause delays, errors, or data loss. This chapter outlines common issues, diagnostic strategies, AWS-native debugging tools, and best practices.

## Common Issues

- **Insufficient Throughput**
  - Example: Kinesis Data Streams or DynamoDB throttles data when provisioned throughput is exceeded.
- **Storage Constraints**
  - Example: Amazon S3 bucket misconfigurations or lifecycle mismanagement lead to failed uploads or versioning overload.
- **Scaling Delays**
  - Example: Amazon RDS or EBS-backed storage underperforms during peak loads due to autoscaling limits or IOPS bottlenecks.

## Techniques for Diagnosis

### 1. **Monitor Resource Utilization**
- **Amazon CloudWatch**
  - Track metrics like `IncomingBytes`, `WriteThroughputExceeded`, `GetRecords.IteratorAgeMilliseconds`.
- **CloudWatch Alarms**
  - Set alarms to trigger when key thresholds (e.g., CPU, memory, Kinesis shard limits) are breached.

### 2. **Analyze Traffic Patterns**
- Detect ingestion surges by plotting data rate over time.
- Adjust resource allocation during expected peaks (holidays, major events).

### 3. **Check AWS Service Limits**
- Use **AWS Trusted Advisor** to:
  - Review RDS connection limits.
  - Evaluate S3 object limits or DynamoDB provisioned capacity.

## Debugging Storage and Ingestion Workflows

### Core AWS Tools

| Tool                      | Use Case                                                                 |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CloudWatch Logs Insights** | Query structured logs from Glue, Lambda, Kinesis pipelines.             |
| **Amazon CloudTrail**     | Audit API calls for access issues or failed service interactions.        |
| **S3 Event Notifications**| Trigger responses to failed uploads, versioning, or object creation.     |
| **AWS Glue Job Metrics**  | Monitor Spark driver/executor performance, I/O times, and retry counts.  |

## Best Practices

- **Enable Retry Logic**
  - Use exponential backoff strategies in Lambda, Glue, or custom ingestion scripts.
- **Partitioning**
  - Partition data in S3 (e.g., by time or region) to improve parallel processing and ingestion performance.
- **Schema Validation**
  - Validate incoming data against expected schemas before ingestion (use Glue or DataBrew).
