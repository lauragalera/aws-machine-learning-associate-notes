- Generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) is a type of AI that can create new content and ideas, including conversations, stories, images, videos, and music. AI technologies attempt to mimic human intelligence in nontraditional computing tasks like image recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and translation. Generative models can analyze animal images to record variables like different ear shapes, eye shapes, tail features, and skin patterns. They can then recreate new animal images that were not in the training set.
