## 3.8.1 On-Demand vs Provisioned Resources

Choosing between on-demand and provisioned cloud resources impacts scalability, cost, and efficiency in ML deployments.

### On-Demand Resources
- Fast provisioning and reliable performance for real-time inference
- Ideal for unpredictable, spiky workloads
- Pay-per-use model (per hour/second); no upfront costs

### Provisioned (Reserved) Resources
- Cost-effective for predictable, steady workloads (e.g., scheduled retraining)
- Best for consistent, predictable workloads
- Lower hourly rates with 1-year or 3-year commitments

#### Key Differences
| Factor            | On-Demand Resources                          | Provisioned Resources                          |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Availability**  | Immediate when needed                        | Pre-allocated; must be reserved in advance      |
| **Pricing Model** | Pay-as-you-go (per second/hour)              | Discounted rates for long-term commitments      |
| **Cost Control**  | Flexible, but potentially higher total cost  | Predictable, potentially lower total cost       |
| **Scalability**   | Highly scalable for dynamic workloads        | Limited scalability; fixed resource capacity    |

## 3.8.2 Scaling

### Auto-Scaling

Automatically adjusts compute resources (EC2 instances, containers) based on demand metrics (traffic, CPU, memory).

Main AWS tools: **Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling** and **Amazon ECS Auto Scaling**

#### Types of Scaling
- **Vertical Scaling (Scale Up/Down):** Increase capacity of existing instances (e.g., more CPU/RAM)
- **Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out/In):** Adjust number of instances; distributes traffic via Elastic Load Balancer

#### Scaling Policies & Trade-offs

1. **Dynamic Scaling (Metric-Based)**
   - Adjusts resources based on usage metrics (CPU, memory, request count)
   - Use case: E-commerce, unpredictable data loads
   - ✅ Efficient use of resources; scales only when demand rises
   - ⚠️ May delay response during scaling; misconfigured alarms can cause issues

2. **Scheduled Scaling**
   - Predefined scaling actions based on known usage schedules (e.g., scale up at 8 AM)
   - Use case: Batch jobs, regular traffic patterns
   - ✅ Low operational overhead; optimized for known workloads
   - ⚠️ Not suitable for unpredictable or bursty traffic

3. **Target Tracking Scaling**
   - Maintains a specific metric target (e.g., keep CPU at 50%) using CloudWatch alarms
   - Use case: Constant performance levels
   - ✅ Keeps resources stable and efficient
   - ⚠️ Choosing the right target can be tricky; struggles with sudden spikes

4. **Step Scaling**
   - Adds/removes resources based on tiered metric thresholds
   - Example: Add 1 instance at 70% CPU for 10 mins; add another at 85%
   - Use case: Flash sales, product launches, expected bursts
   - ✅ Responds incrementally to traffic increases
   - ⚠️ High thresholds → under-provisioning; low thresholds → over-scaling/cost

#### Choosing the Right Scaling Policy
| Policy Type         | Best For                              | Weakness                         |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Dynamic Scaling     | Unpredictable, variable workloads       | Slow reaction if misconfigured   |
| Scheduled Scaling   | Predictable traffic patterns            | Not adaptive to changes          |
| Target Tracking     | Performance-sensitive steady workloads  | Hard to pick the right target    |
| Step Scaling        | Anticipated high surges or traffic spikes | Complex configuration            |

## 3.8.3 Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Options

### What is IaC?
Define and manage AWS infrastructure using scripts, not manual console clicks.

### Key IaC Tools on AWS
- **AWS CloudFormation**
- **AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)**

| Benefit         | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scalability** | Easily replicate environments (dev, test, prod)                             |
| **Reproducibility** | Version-controlled, allowing rollback to previous states                   |
| **Automation**  | Reduces manual setup and human error                                        |
| **Collaboration** | Teams can co-develop infrastructure as code, enabling DevOps/ML Ops flows  |

### AWS CloudFormation
Describe AWS resources in **YAML** or **JSON** templates.

#### Core Concepts
- **Templates:** Define what infrastructure to create
- **Stacks:** Deployed units created from templates
- **Change Sets:** Preview changes before applying updates

The `DependsOn` attribute ensures a resource is created only after its dependencies. If a dependency fails, the stack rolls back.

The `AWS::SageMaker::Model` CloudFormation resource defines an ML model hosted on SageMaker, including:
- Model artifacts (in S3)
- Inference container (image with inference code)
- IAM Role (permissions for SageMaker)
This resource is the foundation for creating a SageMaker endpoint.

#### Pros and Cons
| Pros                                | Cons                                                |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Declarative – describe what, not how| Complex ML architectures can get hard to read       |
| Change Sets = safer deployments     | YAML/JSON is less flexible than general-purpose code|
| Auto rollback on failures           | Not ideal for intricate programmatic logic          |

#### Sample CloudFormation Template
```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Description: 'Simple CloudFormation template for ML infrastructure'
