### Configuring Auto Scaling for SageMaker Endpoints <a name="3212-configuring-auto-scaling-for-sagemaker-endpoints"></a>

**Endpoint Basics:**
- Choose instance type (e.g., `ml.c5.xlarge`, `ml.g4dn.xlarge`).
- Set **min**, **max**, and initial instance counts.

**Steps to Enable Auto Scaling:**
1. **Register a Scalable Target:**
   ```bash
   aws application-autoscaling register-scalable-target \
     --service-namespace sagemaker \
     --resource-id endpoint/<EndpointName>/variant/<VariantName> \
     --scalable-dimension sagemaker:variant:DesiredInstanceCount \
     --min-capacity 1 \
     --max-capacity 10
   ```
2. **Attach a Scaling Policy:**
   - Choose **TargetTrackingScaling** or **StepScaling**.
   - Example metric: `SageMakerVariantInvocationsPerInstance` (target value: **70%**).
3. **Validate by Sending Traffic:**
   - Observe scaling behavior in **CloudWatch**.

**Common Metrics:**
| Metric                      | When to Use                   |

## 3.2.12 Using Spot Instances for Cost Savings <a name="3215-using-spot-instances-for-cost-savings"></a>

**EC2 Spot Instances** let you leverage unused EC2 capacity at up to **90% cost savings** compared to On-Demand pricing—ideal for interruption-tolerant ML workloads.

**Key Features:**
- **Cost Savings:** Run jobs at a fraction of the price, especially during off-peak hours.
- **Interruption Tolerance:** Best for jobs that can handle interruptions (e.g., training with checkpoints).
- **Flexible Scheduling:** Run jobs when capacity is available (e.g., weekends, nights).

**Spot in SageMaker:**
- **Managed Spot Training:**
  - SageMaker uses Spot Instances for training jobs instead of On-Demand.
  - Specify a stopping condition (timeout) for how long SageMaker waits for Spot capacity.
  - Use **checkpoints**: SageMaker saves model state to S3, so jobs can resume after interruption.
- **Custom Spot Inference:**
  - Use ECS/EKS with Spot for cost-effective, real-time inference (advanced use case).

**Scenario Example:**
- Training jobs that can tolerate interruptions and need to minimize cloud costs.

| Use Case                | Description                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Managed Spot Training** | SageMaker uses spare EC2 capacity for training |
| **Custom Spot Inference** | Use ECS/EKS + Spot for real-time inference    |

**Best Practices:**
- **Checkpointing:** Save model state to S3 to resume after interruption.
- **Model Partitioning:** Save intermediate results periodically.
