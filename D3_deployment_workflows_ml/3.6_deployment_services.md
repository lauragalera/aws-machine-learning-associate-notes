# SERVICES FOR DEPLOYMENT

## Amazon SageMaker

Amazon SageMaker is AWS’s all-in-one machine learning platform. It helps with:

- Data labeling
- Model training using built-in algorithms
- Deployment through managed endpoints

With **SageMaker Model Hosting**, models can be deployed as REST endpoints, with built-in:

- Hardware provisioning
- Auto-scaling
- Load management

### Why Use SageMaker for Deployment?

- **Innate Scaling**  
  Automatically adjusts capacity based on request volume.

- **Reduced Ops Overhead**  
  Handles infrastructure, networking, and updates.

- **Tracking & Monitoring**  
  Integrates with **Amazon CloudWatch** for metrics like latency and error rates.

- **Model Versioning & Rollbacks**  
  Use the **SageMaker Model Registry** to manage and revert versions.

### SageMaker Deployment Options

- **Real-Time Endpoints**  
  For fast, low-latency, continuous predictions.

- **Batch Transform**  
  For scheduled or bulk predictions (e.g., hourly jobs).

- **Asynchronous Inference**  
  For long-running inference tasks with deferred response.

- **Serverless Inference**  
  Zero-capacity during idle time; scales automatically when requests increase.

## Other AWS Services for Model Deployment

### AWS Lambda

- **Best for**: Lightweight, event-driven tasks or pre-/post-processing.
- **Pros**:
  - Serverless (no maintenance)
  - Pay-per-call model
- **Cons**:
  - Not suitable for large models or high throughput

### ECS / EKS (Elastic Container & Kubernetes Services)

- **Best for**: Custom container setups or microservices architectures
- **Pros**:
  - Full control over infrastructure
  - Works well for advanced ML environments
- **Cons**:
  - Higher complexity and manual management

### AWS Elastic Beanstalk

- **Best for**: Web apps that include ML models
- **Pros**:
  - Easy setup and deployment
  - Automatically provisions EC2, load balancers, etc.
- **Cons**:
  - Not tailored for ML workflows

### AWS App Runner

- **Best for**: Simple web-based predictions using containers
- **Pros**:
  - Fully managed, auto-scaled container service
- **Cons**:
  - Lacks ML-specific features like monitoring and model registry

## SageMaker Endpoints: Hosting & Features

SageMaker endpoints allow models to be deployed as a **REST API**.

### Endpoint Configuration Includes:
- Model path
- Instance type
- Initial scaling settings
- Optional encryption

### Key Features:
- **Autoscaling**: Based on requests or latency thresholds
- **Multi-Model Endpoints**: Host multiple models on one endpoint
- **Traffic Shifting**: Smooth rollouts by routing partial traffic
- **Secure Access**: IAM, VPC, and SSL integration

## AWS Lambda for Serverless Inference

- **Use case**: Triggered predictions from events like API calls or DB changes
- **Advantages**:
  - Event-driven and cost-efficient
  - Fully serverless and automatically scaled
- **Limitations**:
  - Unsuitable for large models or heavy workloads
  - Not ideal for batch or real-time high-volume inference

### AWS Lambda for Model Serving

For infrequent inference tasks, Lambda is more cost-efficient than running SageMaker 24/7.

### Architecture:

- Lambda function holds the model or pulls it from **S3**, **EFS**, or **ECR**
- Triggers: **S3 events**, **API Gateway**, **EventBridge**
- Performs inference, then terminates

### ⚠️ Trade-Offs:

| Limitation          | Notes                                         |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Cold Starts         | Delay during first load, especially for large models |
| Memory Limits       | Max 10GB RAM – may be too low for some models |
| Stateless           | Unsuitable for stateful or GPU-heavy workloads |

## Comparative Analysis

| Deployment Option | Scalability                  | Cost                     | Control                       | Complexity         |
|------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|
| **SageMaker**     | Auto-scales by traffic       | Pay-as-you-go            | Limited (managed service)     | Low                |
| **Lambda**        | Event-driven scaling         | Low for small workloads  | Minimal                       | Low                |
| **ECS/EKS**       | Highly scalable, configurable| Potentially higher       | Full control over containers  | High               |

## Summary

- **SageMaker Endpoints**: Best for **managed, scalable**, and **real-time** ML model hosting.
- **AWS Lambda**: Ideal for **small, serverless, event-triggered** inference jobs.
- **ECS/EKS**: Suitable for **custom container setups** and **advanced orchestration** needs.
