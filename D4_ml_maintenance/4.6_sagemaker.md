## 4.6.1 Security and Compliance Features

Amazon SageMaker provides built-in features for confidentiality, integrity, and compliance in ML workflows.

### Data Encryption
Protects sensitive information in the cloud.
- **At Rest:**
  - S3: SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, client-side encryption
  - EBS: AES-256 or customer-managed keys
  - KMS: Manage/control keys, audit with CloudTrail
- **In Transit:**
  - HTTPS endpoints (TLS/SSL)
  - Secure predictions via HTTPS
  - VPC endpoints for private connectivity

### SageMaker Model Registry
Purpose-built for storing, versioning, and managing ML models.
- Organize models into model groups for version control
- Track training data, hyperparameters, metrics, and metadata
- Control model approval status for production deployment
---

## 4.6.2 Role-Based Access Control

### SageMaker Role Manager
Simplifies IAM role creation/management for SageMaker resources.
- Guided interface for fine-grained permissions
- Define S3 bucket access, endpoint management, VPC config
- Templates and best practices for least privilege
- Consistent naming and structured policies for auditing

---

## 4.6.3 Proactive Monitoring and Optimization

Proactive monitoring maintains model health, performance, and cost efficiency.

### Model Degradation Alerts
Detects data drift/concept drift and model performance drops.
- SageMaker Model Monitor tracks performance and input data drift
- Configure alerts for:
  - Accuracy drop
  - Latency increase
  - Precision/recall metric changes

### Cost Anomaly Alerts
Monitor AWS usage and set alerts for cost spikes.
- AWS Cost Explorer and Budgets for cost monitoring
- Alerts for budget limits and underutilized resources
- Integrate Budgets with SNS for notifications

## 4.6.4 Proactive Measures: Overfitting & Concept Drift

Monitoring is important, but prevention is vital.

### Preventing Overfitting
Overfitting: Model learns noise/random fluctuations, performs poorly on new data.
- Cross-validation (e.g., k-fold) to evaluate on different splits
- Regularization (L2/L1) penalizes large coefficients
- Early stopping halts training when validation declines
- Use SageMaker Hyperparameter Tuning to optimize regularization/dropout

### Preventing Concept Drift
Concept drift: Relationship between features and target changes over time.
- Continuous monitoring with SageMaker Model Monitor
- Scheduled/event-driven retraining with SageMaker Pipelines
- Data augmentation (e.g., SMOTE) for robustness
- Configure Model Monitor to compare production/training data and trigger retraining
