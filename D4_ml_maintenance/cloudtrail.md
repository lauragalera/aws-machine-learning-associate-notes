# Using CloudTrail for Monitoring and Retraining

## Setting Up CloudTrail for ML Workflows

**AWS CloudTrail** records and stores API requests made to AWS services, including **Amazon SageMaker**. This helps trace user actions like starting training jobs or retraining models.

### Creating CloudTrail Trails

- Logs all **API calls**, including SageMaker actions (e.g., `CreateTrainingJob`, `UpdateModel`).
- Trails include **management** and **data events**.

### Setup Steps

1. Go to **AWS Management Console** > **CloudTrail**.
2. Create a new trail and give it a name.
3. Enable **global tracking** (optional for all-region coverage).
4. Choose an **S3 bucket** to store logs.
5. Enable **CloudWatch Logs integration** for real-time monitoring and alerts.

## Tracking Retraining Activities

CloudTrail logs contain detailed info about retraining actions:
- **Timestamp**, **IP address**, **IAM user**, and **API method** (e.g., `CreateTrainingJob`, `StartModelTraining`).

## Auditing Access

CloudTrail enables full **auditing of user actions**:
- Identifies **who accessed** ML resources.
- Records **what action** was taken.
- Confirms whether **access was permitted or denied**.

### Monitoring Unauthorized Access

- Detect unauthorized attempts to trigger retraining or access data.
- Use **CloudWatch Alarms** to flag suspicious actions.

## Maintaining Compliance

Especially important in regulated industries (e.g., **finance**, **healthcare**), CloudTrail ensures that ML workflows meet standards like **GDPR**, **HIPAA**, and **SOX**.

## CloudTrail Best Practices for ML Monitoring & Compliance

- **Enable Multi-Region Trails**: Capture activity across all AWS regions.
- **Integrate with CloudWatch Logs**: Real-time alerts for unauthorized retraining.
- **Use Strong IAM Policies**: Apply least privilege and role-specific access.
- **Set Retention Policies**: Define how long logs are stored to meet legal requirements.

AWS CloudTrail logs API calls for auditing purposes and can detect unusual activity using CloudTrail Insights. However, it is not designed for threshold-based alarms.
