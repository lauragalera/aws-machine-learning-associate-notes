AWS CloudTrail records and stores API requests made to AWS services, including Amazon SageMaker. It helps trace user actions like starting training jobs or retraining models.

## 4.1.1 Setting Up CloudTrail for ML Workflows

**CloudTrail Trails:**
- Logs all API calls, including SageMaker actions (e.g., `CreateTrainingJob`, `UpdateModel`)
- Trails include management and data events

**Setup Steps:**
1. Go to AWS Management Console > CloudTrail
2. Create a new trail and name it
3. Enable global tracking (optional for all-region coverage)
4. Choose an S3 bucket to store logs
5. Enable CloudWatch Logs integration for real-time monitoring and alerts

## 4.1.2 Tracking Retraining Activities & Auditing Access

CloudTrail logs contain detailed info about retraining actions and user access:
- Timestamp, IP address, IAM user, and API method (e.g., `CreateTrainingJob`, `StartModelTraining`)
- Identifies who accessed ML resources
- Records what action was taken
- Confirms whether access was permitted or denied

## 4.1.3 Why CloudTrail is Best for SageMaker Auditing, Monitoring, and Compliance

CloudTrail is the best solution for logging all actions performed on SageMaker resources because it captures detailed API call history and user activity. This enables compliance auditing and detection of unauthorized or accidental changes.

- **AWS Config:** Tracks resource configuration changes, but not detailed user activity or API calls
- **IAM Access Analyzer:** Focuses on policy validation, not activity logging
- **CloudWatch:** Monitors metrics/logs, but does not natively capture API-level actions for auditing

CloudTrail’s detailed event records and support for insights to detect unusual activity make it the optimal choice.

### Monitoring Unauthorized Access & Maintaining Compliance

- Detect unauthorized attempts to trigger retraining or access data
- Use CloudWatch Alarms to flag suspicious actions
- CloudTrail ensures ML workflows meet standards like GDPR, HIPAA, and SOX—especially important in regulated industries (finance, healthcare).

### CloudTrail Best Practices for ML

- Enable Multi-Region Trails: Capture activity across all AWS regions
- Integrate with CloudWatch Logs: Real-time alerts for unauthorized retraining
- Use Strong IAM Policies: Apply least privilege and role-specific access
- Set Retention Policies: Define log storage duration to meet legal requirements

CloudTrail logs API calls for auditing and can detect unusual activity using CloudTrail Insights. It is not designed for threshold-based alarms.
