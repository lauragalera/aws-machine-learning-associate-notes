# Key Performance Metrics for ML Infrastructure

Tracking machine learning (ML) infrastructure performance is vital for ensuring it can support training, deployment, and large-scale inference reliably.

## Utilization: Measuring Resource Usage

Utilization metrics indicate how effectively infrastructure resources are being used (CPU, GPU, memory, storage).

### CPU Utilization
- **Formula**:  
  `CPU Utilization = (CPU Usage / Total CPU Capacity) √ó 100`
- **Best Practices**:
  - Monitor during both high and low activity.
  - Scale infrastructure or optimize workloads if usage stays high.
  - Enable multi-core processing.

### GPU Utilization
- **Formula**:  
  `GPU Utilization = (GPU Usage / Total GPU Capacity) √ó 100`
- **Best Practices**:
  - Distribute tasks across multiple GPUs.
  - Monitor GPU memory usage to avoid over-allocation.

### Memory Utilization
- **Formula**:  
  `Memory Utilization = (Memory Usage / Total Memory) √ó 100`
- **Best Practices**:
  - Ensure enough memory for large datasets or complex models.
  - Use memory-efficient algorithms like mini-batch gradient descent.

### Storage Utilization
- **Formula**:  
  `Storage Utilization = (Used Storage / Total Storage Capacity) √ó 100`
- **Best Practices**:
  - Monitor disk I/O.
  - Regularly clean up old models, logs, and intermediate artifacts.

### Tools for Resource Monitoring
- **AWS CloudWatch** ‚Äì Monitor CPU, memory, disk on EC2.
- **NVIDIA `nvidia-smi`** ‚Äì Monitor GPU usage and memory.
- **Prometheus + Grafana** ‚Äì Real-time resource monitoring dashboards.

## Throughput and Scalability

### Throughput
Measures how fast the system processes data ‚Äî critical for training and inference.

- **Formula**:  
  `Throughput = Total Data Processed / Time Taken`
- **Best Practices**:
  - Monitor data pipeline throughput (e.g., ETL jobs).
  - Scale resources to match data growth (larger instances or more nodes).

### Scalability
Describes the system‚Äôs ability to grow and handle more load.

### Tools for Scalability
- **Amazon CloudWatch** ‚Äì Throughput monitoring, auto-scaling alerts.
- **EC2 Auto Scaling** ‚Äì Adjust instance count based on load.
- **SageMaker Distributed Training** ‚Äì Distribute workloads across instances.

## 3. Fault Tolerance and Availability

### ‚úÖ Availability
Indicates system uptime over time.

- **Formula**:  
  `Availability = (1 ‚àí Downtime / Total Time) √ó 100`
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use multi-AZ deployments (e.g., SageMaker, EC2).
  - Deploy Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) to route traffic across healthy instances.

### Fault Tolerance
Ensures the system continues operating during failures.

- **Techniques**:
  - **Replication**: Duplicate data/models across servers/regions.
  - **Automatic Failover**: Tools like RDS Multi-AZ and S3 cross-region replication.

- **Best Practices**:
  - Schedule backups and snapshots.
  - Implement health checks and automated instance replacement.

### Tools for Fault Tolerance & Availability
- **Amazon CloudWatch Alarms** ‚Äì Trigger actions on system health issues.
- **AWS ELB (Elastic Load Balancer)** ‚Äì Distributes traffic for high availability.
- **Amazon Route 53** ‚Äì DNS-based failover routing.

# Tools for Infrastructure Monitoring
