# AWS Machine Learning Associate Notes

I passed the **AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer Associate** on July 4th 2025  and created these notes during my study journey.

I hope they help you prepare and succeed! 😊

## 💡 FAQs

### ❓ What is this cert really about?

- 70%: Deep dive into Amazon SageMaker and its thoushand features.

- 20%: Other AWS services, mostly focused on AI, monitoring and data flow.

- 10%: Basic concepts about ML (classification, regression, overfitting, evaluation metrics, plots, etc).


### 🔁 What overlaps with other certs?
I found overlap with the Data Engineer Associate, especially around S3, Kinesis, and Glue. Also, If you’re already familiar with compute services like Lambda or ECS, you’ll feel more comfortable navigating the SageMaker integrations and deployments.

### 🤔 Should this be your first AWS cert?

Even if you're a data scientist or working in a similar role, I wouldn't recommend this as your first AWS certification. 

You’ll need a solid understanding of multiple services to truly grasp how to build end-to-end ML solutions on AWS. If you're just starting out, I’d suggest beginning with the AWS Certified AI Practitioner.


### ⏱ Prep time:

What helped me the most this time was what I learned during the Master’s degree, the Tutorials Dojo Study Guide, and the official AWS SageMaker documentation.

Most of my preparation time was spent on practice exams, carefully reviewing missed questions, and creating my own summarized notes. In total, I spent around 40 hours.
