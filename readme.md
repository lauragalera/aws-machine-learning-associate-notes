## ðŸ’¡ FAQs

### Is it difficult?
The exam is moderately challenging, especially if youâ€™re new to AWS ML services like SageMaker, Glue, and S3. Youâ€™ll need a solid grasp of ML concepts, AWS integrations, and best practices for deployment and monitoring.

### Should this be your first AWS certification?
It can be, but starting with the **AWS Solutions Architect â€“ Associate** or **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** is helpful for foundational AWS knowledge.

### How long does preparation take?
It depends on your background. If youâ€™re already working with AWS ML, focus on practice exams and reviewing key concepts. For most, 40â€“60 hours of study is typical.
